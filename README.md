To run the project correctly, first install the dependencies with the command pip install -r requirements.txt. Then, follow the two main steps, performed in a specific order. First, run python train_model.py to train the model. Finally, run python test_model.py to evaluate the trained model on test data. After completing these steps, you can navigate to the results folder to view a collection of generated graphs. These visualizations illustrate both the pre- and post-training data, providing insight into how the model learned from the input data. Make sure all dependencies are installed.
