To run the project successfully, you need to follow five main steps, executed in a specific order. First, run python process_development.py to preprocess the development dataset. Then, use python process_training.py to prepare the training data, followed by python process_test.py to process the test dataset. Once all data is properly prepared, execute python train_model.py to train the model. Finally, run python test_model.py to evaluate the trained model on the test data. After completing these steps, you can navigate to the results folder to view a collection of generated graphs. These visualizations illustrate the data both before and after training, providing insights into how the model has learned from the input data. Make sure all dependencies are installed and that the required input files are correctly placed before starting the process.
