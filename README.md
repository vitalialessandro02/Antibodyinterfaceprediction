To run the project successfully, first install the dependencies with the pip install -r requirements.txt command. Then, follow five main steps, performed in a specific order. First, run python process_development.py to preprocess the development dataset. Then, use python process_training.py to prepare the training data, followed by python process_test.py to process the test dataset. Once all the data is properly prepared, run python train_model.py to train the model. Finally, run python test_model.py to evaluate the trained model on the test data. After completing these steps, you can navigate to the results folder to view a collection of generated graphs. These visualizations illustrate the data both before and after training, providing insight into how the model learned from the input data. Make sure all dependencies are installed and the required input files are correctly located before starting the project.
